## Step-by-step Breakdown: How Each Component Fits Into the Bigger Picture

### 1. **Imports & Setup**
- **Imports Deno server, Supabase client, and relevant TypeScript types.**
- **Initializes Supabase client** from environment variables for connecting to the backend database.

### 2. **Type Definitions**
- **InvoiceItem, Invoice, Client, InvoiceTemplate:** Strongly-typed interfaces for all core entities, supporting both English/Swahili and Kenya-specific fields (e.g., KRA PIN, VAT, M-Pesa, business type).

### 3. **Constants**
- **Kenya-specific VAT rate, default currency, etc.** These ensure compliance and correct calculations.

### 4. **Utility Functions**
- **ID generation, invoice number generation, KES formatting, KRA PIN validation, phone validation/formatting, VAT calculations, and item/category inference.**
- **Natural language item parser:** Allows quick invoice creation from plain text (e.g., "20 bags rice at 3000"), supporting English and Swahili.

### 5. **Validation Functions**
- **For client and invoice creation, including strict checks for required fields and format compliance (email, phone, KRA PIN, etc.).**

### 6. **Invoice Templates**
- **Predefined templates for retail, services, trading, etc.,** with both English and Swahili options. Used for rapid invoice creation and business-type-specific defaults.

### 7. **WhatsApp Integration**
- **Functions to send invoices and reminders via WhatsApp API,** with multilingual support for messaging.

### 8. **PDF Generation**
- **Function to generate a detailed, multilingual invoice PDF as a text block,** including summary, client details, items, VAT, status, etc.

### 9. **MCP Tools Definition**
- **Comprehensive list of supported operations:** create client, quick invoice (from text), invoice from template, sending via WhatsApp, marking paid via M-Pesa, reminders, overdue list, analytics, template listing, CRUD operations for invoices and clients, PDF generation, and summary statistics.
- **Each tool is described with its name, purpose, and strict input schema.**

### 10. **Tool Handlers**
- **Main logic for each MCP tool,** including database operations, validation, business logic, PDF generation, WhatsApp sending, analytics, and error handling.
- **Handles all CRUD, analytics, and messaging operations in a modular way.**

### 11. **Edge Function Handler**
- **Main HTTP handler for Deno Deploy/Supabase Edge Functions.**
- **Supports CORS, MCP protocol (`tools/list`, `tools/call`), error management, and direct tool calls.**

### 12. **Database Schema Documentation**
- **Complete SQL schema for `clients` and `invoices` tables,** plus recommended indexes for high performance.
- **Ensures the backend is aligned with the code’s requirements and supports all features described above.**

- **PDF Generation** offers professional, bilingual invoice output for sharing and recordkeeping.
- **Edge Function Handler** exposes everything as a modern API endpoint, ready for integration with frontends, bots, or other services.
- **Database Schema** ensures persistent, reliable, and query-efficient storage.
