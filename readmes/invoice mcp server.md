Proper error handling for database operations

3. HTTP Server Structure:

Uses Deno's serve() function instead of stdio transport
Handles HTTP requests/responses with JSON
Added CORS headers for web compatibility

4. Database Schema Requirements:
You'll need to create these tables in your Supabase database:
sql-- Clients table
CREATE TABLE clients (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  address TEXT NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT,
  tax_id TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Invoices table
CREATE TABLE invoices (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  invoice_number TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
  client_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  client_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  client_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  issue_date DATE NOT NULL,
  due_date DATE NOT NULL,
  items JSONB NOT NULL,
  subtotal DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  tax_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'sent', 'paid', 'overdue', 'cancelled')) DEFAULT 'draft',
  notes TEXT,
  payment_terms TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
